## About me
Hello! I usually go as Flonc but using my github name is also fine. At the time of writing, I currently have nearly 2 years yet still have not done anything much. 

## Languages I know
Have been doing Python since august 2020 and know basics of some other languages. Currently trying to learn rust but don't have much to make with it.
Also know some web dev but that doesn't count.

## Contact Me
